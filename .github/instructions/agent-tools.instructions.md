# Agent Tools & Execution

## Agent Executor Architecture — Decomposed Structure

The agent execution logic lives in `src/agent/execution/` and follows a **strict single-responsibility decomposition**. The executor was decomposed from a monolithic 800-line class into focused sub-handlers, organized into subfolders by concern. **This structure is intentional — do NOT merge files back together or add new responsibilities to the orchestrator.**

### `AgentChatExecutor` — The Orchestrator

**This class MUST stay thin.** It owns:
- Constructor wiring of sub-handlers
- The main `execute()` while-loop (iteration orchestration)
- `persistUiEvent()` — the shared persist-to-DB helper
- `persistGitBranchAction()` — git branch UI event sequence
- Session memory injection into system prompt
- `parseToolCalls()` — native vs XML extraction dispatch
- `logIterationResponse()` — debug output channel logging
- Pass-through delegates to `checkpointManager` and `approvalManager`
- `buildContinuationMessage()` — **REMOVED** — replaced by `agentControlPlane.buildLoopContinuationMessage()` (see Conversation History Protocol below)
- Post-task verification gate — diagnostics check on modified files before accepting `[TASK_COMPLETE]`
- Output truncation handling — detects `StreamResult.truncated` and sends "continue where you left off" message
- Session memory DB persistence — saves `sessionMemory.toJSON()` via `databaseService.saveSessionMemory()` after loop
- Explorer model resolution — `resolveExplorerCapabilities()` resolves the sub-agent model with cache
- Duplicate tool call detection — filters intra-batch and cross-iteration duplicate calls

#### Orchestrator Tool Restriction

The orchestrator (agent mode executor) is restricted to **only 3 tools**: `write_file`, `run_terminal_command`, and `run_subagent`. All other tools (read_file, search_workspace, LSP tools, etc.) are filtered out and only available to sub-agents via the explore executor.

**Implementation:**
- `AgentPromptBuilder` has a static `ORCHESTRATOR_TOOLS` set: `{'write_file', 'run_terminal_command', 'run_subagent'}`
- `getOrchestratorToolDefinitions()` filters `getOllamaToolDefinitions()` by this set → used for native tool mode
- `buildOrchestratorToolDefinitions_XML()` filters tool descriptions → used for XML fallback mode
- `agentChatExecutor.ts` uses `getOrchestratorToolDefinitions()` for both the chat request `tools[]` array and token estimation
- The `orchestratorDelegationStrategy()` prompt section instructs the model on the SCOUT → EXPLORE → WRITE → VERIFY workflow

**Rationale:** Prevents the orchestrator from wasting context window on file reads. Research is offloaded to sub-agents that run with their own context window.

#### Explorer Model Resolution

The orchestrator resolves which model to use for sub-agents via a **3-tier fallback**:

1. **Per-session override** — `sessionController.getSessionExplorerModel()`
2. **Global setting** — `getConfig().agent.explorerModel`
3. **Same model** — falls back to the orchestrator's own model (empty string → use `config.model`)

**Implementation:** `resolveExplorerCapabilities()` in `agentChatExecutor.ts`:
- Caches capabilities per `(model, sessionId)` to avoid repeated API calls
- Tries DB cache first (`databaseService.getModelCapabilities()`)
- Falls back to live `/api/show` via `getModelCapabilities()`
- Determines `useNativeTools` and `useThinking` for the sub-agent
- The resolved model and capabilities are passed through the `runSubagent` closure

#### Duplicate Tool Call Detection

After tool calls are parsed each iteration, the executor deduplicates them:

1. **Intra-batch dedup** — removes exact duplicates within the same iteration (same tool name + same args)
2. **Cross-iteration dedup** — removes calls that were made with identical arguments in the last 2 iterations (tracked via `recentToolSignatures` Map)
3. **Batch cap** — limits to `MAX_TOOLS_PER_BATCH` (10) tool calls per iteration
4. **All-duplicate handling** — if every tool call was a duplicate, injects a warning message telling the model to try different tools or complete the task
5. **Signature expiry** — old signatures are evicted after 3 iterations to allow legitimate re-reads

#### Conversation History Protocol

The executor follows strict Ollama API conventions to prevent models from repeating actions and losing context. This was redesigned to eliminate 7 sources of redundancy (see Pitfall #37).

##### Native Tool Calling Mode (`useNativeTools = true`)

Each iteration produces this conversation history pattern:
```
role: 'assistant'  { content: "explanation...", tool_calls: [...] }
role: 'tool'       { content: "result1", tool_name: "read_file" }
role: 'tool'       { content: "result2", tool_name: "write_file" }
role: 'user'       { content: "<agent_control>{...}</agent_control>" }
```

**Key rules:**
- Assistant messages carry `tool_calls` as **structured data** — NO `[Called:]` text appended to `content`
- Tool results use `role: 'tool'` with `tool_name` field (Ollama protocol — NOT `tool_call_id`)
- When assistant `response` is empty (thinking model produced only thinking + tool_calls), `buildToolCallSummary()` generates a brief deterministic description of the tool calls (e.g. "I searched for 'query' and read src/file.ts"). Falls back to `'[Reasoning completed]'` only when no tools were called. This gives the model enough context to build on its previous actions without re-deriving the same plan (see Pitfall #38).
- Continuation is a slim `<agent_control>` JSON packet (state, iteration budget, changed files)

##### XML Fallback Mode (`useNativeTools = false`)

```
role: 'assistant'  { content: "explanation...\n[Called:] tool_name1, tool_name2" }
role: 'user'       { content: "<agent_control>{..., \"toolResults\": \"[read_file result]...\"}</agent_control>" }
```

- Tool results are embedded inside the `<agent_control>` packet via `formatTextToolResults()`
- `[Called:]` summarizes which tools were invoked (since no structured `tool_calls` field)

##### Agent Control Plane (`agentControlPlane.ts`)

All continuation messages use `buildLoopContinuationMessage()` from the control plane module. This function emits structured `<agent_control>` JSON packets:

```json
{
  "state": "need_tools",
  "iteration": 3,
  "maxIterations": 25,
  "remainingIterations": 22,
  "filesChanged": ["src/main.ts"],
  "note": "Continue executing your plan."
}
```

The `state` field is derived from an `AgentLoopEvent` via `resolveControlState()`:
- `'tool_results'` → `'need_tools'` (model should continue using tools)
- `'no_tools'` → `'need_tools'` (model returned text without tools — nudge it)
- `'diagnostics_found'` → `'need_fixes'` (diagnostics reported errors post-write)

**Anti-repetition**: `buildLoopContinuationMessage()` appends a natural-language directive **after** the JSON packet: `"Do NOT repeat your previous response. Proceed directly with tool calls or respond with [TASK_COMPLETE] when finished."` This is at the highest recency position (the last content before the model generates) — critical for smaller models (≤30B) that ignore instructions buried in the system prompt. The system prompt also has a CONTINUATION BEHAVIOR section as a belt-and-suspenders measure.

##### DB History Loading

When loading conversation history from the database (session resume):
- **Native mode**: `role: 'tool'` messages are preserved with `tool_name` and structured `tool_calls` on assistant messages
- **XML mode**: Messages are loaded as `role: 'user'` with `[tool_name result]` prefix format
- Stale `[SYSTEM NOTE:]` messages are stripped on each iteration to prevent accumulation

##### Session Memory Deduplication

`toSystemReminder()` outputs a `## Task Reference` section with a **120-character preview** of the original task (not the full text, which is always in `messages[1]`). This prevents the task from appearing 3+ times in the context.

**Do NOT bypass the control plane** with hardcoded continuation messages — all continuation logic flows through `buildLoopContinuationMessage()`.

#### Post-Task Verification Gate

When the LLM emits `[TASK_COMPLETE]`, the executor does NOT immediately accept it. Instead:
1. Collects all files modified during the session from `agentSession.filesChanged`
2. Calls `getErrorDiagnostics()` + `formatDiagnostics()` (from `diagnosticWaiter.ts`) on each file
3. If errors are found, sends a continuation message with the diagnostics and re-enters the loop
4. Uses `agentSession._verificationDone` guard to prevent infinite verification loops (only runs once)
5. If no errors, accepts the completion normally

#### Thinking-in-History — No Thinking Content in History

Per Ollama issue #10448 and Qwen3 docs: **"No Thinking Content in History — historical model output should only include the final output part."** Including the `thinking` field on previous assistant messages causes models to see ALL their prior reasoning in the rendered prompt. This triggers repetition loops where the model re-derives the same plan every iteration. Ollama v0.6.7+ strips `<think>` from the `content` field via templates, but the separate `thinking` API field bypasses that protection.

**The fix has two layers**:
1. **Never assign `thinking` on history messages**: All `if (thinkingContent) msg.thinking = thinkingContent` lines have been removed. Assistant messages use `response || (thinkingContent ? '[Reasoning completed]' : '')` as `content` only.
2. **Defensive strip before API call**: Both executors strip `thinking` from ALL messages right before building the `chatRequest` — catches any edge case where thinking might leak from external sources.

```typescript
// Agent executor — assistant message building:
const historyContent = response || (thinkingContent ? '[Reasoning completed]' : '');
const assistantMsg: any = { role: 'assistant', content: historyContent };
// NO thinking field — per Ollama #10448
messages.push(assistantMsg);
```

**TASK_COMPLETE detection**: Also checks `thinkingContent` via `isCompletionSignaled()` — thinking models may signal completion only in their thinking field.

**CRITICAL**: The modified content is for the in-memory `messages` array only. DB persist uses original `response`. Thinking content is separately persisted as a `thinkingBlock` UI event — no data loss.

**No repetition safety nets**: All similarity-based repetition detection has been removed. Stripping thinking from history addresses the root cause (model sees prior reasoning), not the symptom (repeated output).

### `AgentExploreExecutor` — Read-Only Modes

Handles explore, plan, review, deep-explore, and chat modes. Key differences from `AgentChatExecutor`:
- **No checkpoints** — read-only tools don't modify files
- **No approval flow** — no writes or destructive commands to approve
- **Tool filtering** — blocks any non-read-only tools the model attempts to call
- **Per-mode iteration caps** — `{ review: 15, 'deep-explore': 20, plan: 10, chat: 10, explore: 10 }` (vs 25 for agent mode)
- **Mode-specific prompts** via `AgentPromptBuilder.buildExplorePrompt()` / `buildPlanPrompt()` / `buildSecurityReviewPrompt()` / `buildDeepExplorePrompt()` / `buildChatPrompt()`
- Review mode additionally allows `run_terminal_command` (restricted to git read commands in the prompt)
- Deep-explore mode additionally allows `run_subagent` (13 tools total: 12 read-only + run_subagent)

**It does NOT own** streaming, tool execution, diff stats, summary generation, terminal safety, or file sensitivity. Those are in the sub-handlers.

#### Sub-Agent Isolation (`isSubagent` Mode)

When `execute()` is called with `isSubagent=true` (via `executeSubagent()`), the executor runs in an **isolated mode** that prevents the sub-agent from polluting the parent agent's webview timeline or session state. This fixes three critical bugs: duplicate assistant messages, leaked thinking text, and hallucinated file writes.

**Filtered emitter pattern:** The executor creates a filtered `emit` helper that only passes through tool UI event types to the parent's webview:

| Passes Through | Suppressed |
|----------------|------------|
| `startProgressGroup` | `streamChunk` |
| `showToolAction` | `iterationBoundary` |
| `finishProgressGroup` | `thinkingBlock` |
| `showError` | `collapseThinking` |
| `showWarningBanner` | `tokenUsage` |
| `subagentThinking` | `finalMessage` |
| | `hideThinking` |
| | Iteration text DB messages |

**Silent stream processor:** A separate `AgentStreamProcessor` instance is created with a no-op emitter — the sub-agent's streaming text accumulates internally but is never posted to the webview. The user sees progress groups and tool actions (so they know the sub-agent is working) but not the raw LLM output.

**Sub-agent thinking (`subagentThinking`):** When a sub-agent produces thinking content, the explore executor emits a `subagentThinking` message (only allowed through the filtered emitter) and persists it via `persistUiEvent`. The webview attaches this thinking to the last progress group as a collapsible `<details>` block. This lets the user optionally inspect the sub-agent's reasoning without cluttering the timeline. Handled by `handleSubagentThinking()` in `progress.ts` (live) and `timelineBuilder.ts` (session restore).

**Sub-agent context hint (`subagentContextHint`):** The `execute()` method accepts an optional `subagentContextHint: string` parameter. When running as a sub-agent, this hint is forwarded via `executeSubagent()` from the `run_subagent` tool and passed to `buildSubAgentExplorePrompt()` in `agentPromptBuilder.ts`. The prompt includes a "FOCUS AREA" section with the hint, helping the sub-agent narrow its investigation scope. The sub-agent prompt also enforces an output budget ("Keep your final response under 1500 words") and compact exploration strategy.

**Why each suppression matters:**
- `finalMessage` — Resets `currentStreamIndex` in the webview, which causes the parent's next `streamChunk` to create a NEW assistant thread instead of continuing the existing one (Pitfall #34).
- `streamChunk` — Sub-agent's inner monologue would interleave with the parent's timeline text.
- `thinkingBlock` / `collapseThinking` — Would insert orphan thinking blocks into the parent's assistant message.
- `tokenUsage` — Would overwrite the parent's token usage indicator with the sub-agent's counts.
- `iterationBoundary` — Would corrupt the parent's `blockBaseContent` tracking for multi-iteration streaming.

**Sub-agent text return:** The sub-agent's accumulated text is returned as a string to the `run_subagent` tool, which passes it back to the parent agent as a tool result. The parent can then act on the findings.

**Prompt enforcement:** `buildExplorePrompt()` tells the sub-agent it is read-only and its output goes to the calling agent (not the user). `toolUsagePolicy()` tells the parent agent that sub-agent results are returned only to it and the user doesn't see them — the parent must act on the findings itself.

#### Sub-Agent UI Rendering

When a sub-agent runs, it renders as a **dedicated collapsible progress group** (not a flat action):
- The wrapper `startProgressGroup` is emitted by the explore executor (via `this.emitter.postMessage`, NOT the filtered `emit`) with title `Sub-agent: <title>`
- The sub-agent's internal tool actions (`showToolAction`) pass through the filtered emitter and nest inside this wrapper group
- Per-iteration `startProgressGroup`/`finishProgressGroup` from the sub-agent's internal tool batches are suppressed by the filter
- The parent orchestrator suppresses its own `showToolAction` (running/success) for `run_subagent` calls — the wrapper group is the sole UI representation
- When the batch contains only `run_subagent` calls, the parent also skips its own wrapping progress group ("Delegating subtask") to avoid redundant nesting

The `title` is provided by the orchestrator via the `run_subagent` tool's `title` parameter (required). The optional `description` parameter provides a one-sentence detail shown in the progress group header after the title (muted, inline with " — " separator). The `toolUIFormatter.ts` also uses `title` (falling back to `task`) for the progress action display text.

### `AgentStreamProcessor` — LLM Streaming

Owns the `for await (chunk of stream)` loop. Takes a chat request and returns:

```typescript
interface StreamResult {
  response: string;           // Full accumulated response text
  thinkingContent: string;    // Full accumulated thinking/CoT text
  nativeToolCalls: OllamaToolCall[];  // Native tool calls from API
  firstChunkReceived: boolean; // Whether any text was sent to UI
  lastThinkingTimestamp: number; // Timestamp (ms) of last thinking token
  thinkingCollapsed: boolean;    // Whether collapseThinking was already sent
  truncated: boolean;            // Whether output was truncated (done_reason === 'length')
  promptTokens?: number;         // Real prompt_eval_count from Ollama's final chunk
  completionTokens?: number;     // Real eval_count from Ollama's final chunk
}
```

The `promptTokens` and `completionTokens` fields are captured from the final chunk's `prompt_eval_count` and `eval_count` fields. These are **real token counts** from Ollama (not heuristics). Used by:
- Both executors to emit `tokenUsage` messages to the webview (category breakdown via `estimateTokensByCategory()`)
- `agentContextCompactor.ts` `compactIfNeeded()` — uses real `promptTokens` when available, falls back to `estimateTokens()` heuristic for the first iteration

Handles: thinking token accumulation, native tool_call accumulation, text content accumulation with 32ms throttled UI emission, first-chunk gate (≥8 word chars), `[TASK_COMPLETE]` partial-prefix stripping, partial tool call detection (XML fallback freezing), output truncation detection.

#### Output Truncation Detection

Ollama returns `done_reason: 'length'` in the final chunk when the model's output was truncated due to context window limits. The stream processor detects this and sets `truncated: true` in the `StreamResult`. The executor then sends a continuation message ("Your last response was truncated. Continue exactly where you left off.") so the model can finish its thought.

#### Early Thinking Collapse on Native Tool Calls

When native `tool_calls` arrive during streaming, the stream processor **immediately** collapses the thinking group rather than waiting for the stream to end:

1. Computes accurate `durationSeconds` from `lastThinkingTimestamp - thinkingStartTime` (excludes Ollama's tool_call buffering time)
2. Sends `collapseThinking` with `durationSeconds` to the webview — thinking header changes from "Thinking..." → "Thought for 8s" instantly
3. Extracts filenames from write_file/create_file tool_call arguments and shows "Writing filename.ts..." in the bottom spinner
4. Sets `thinkingCollapsed = true` so the executor skips sending a duplicate `collapseThinking`

**Why**: Ollama buffers native tool_call content internally (10–80s for large files). Without early collapse, the thinking group header shows "Thinking..." for the entire buffering duration, making it appear the model is still thinking when it's actually generating file content.

**`thinkingStartTime` parameter**: The executor passes `thinkingStartTime` (captured before `streamIteration()`) to the stream processor so it can compute accurate duration without depending on executor state.

### `AgentToolRunner` — Tool Batch Execution

Executes all tool calls in a single iteration as a batch. Routes to terminal handler, file-edit handler, or generic `ToolRegistry.execute()`. Returns:

```typescript
interface ToolBatchResult {
  nativeResults: Array<{ role: 'tool'; content: string; tool_name: string }>;
  xmlResults: string[];
  wroteFiles: boolean;  // Whether any file write succeeded (not skipped)
}
```

Handles: per-tool "running"→"success"/"error" UI events, `persistUiEvent` for each action, inline diff stats computation (`+N -N` badges), incremental `filesChanged` emission, tool result persistence to DB, skipped-action detection, auto-diagnostics injection after file writes.

#### Auto-Diagnostics After File Writes

After every successful `write_file` tool execution, the tool runner automatically:
1. Calls `waitForDiagnostics(fileUri, 3000)` — event-driven wait for the language server to process the file (uses `onDidChangeDiagnostics`, falls back to timeout)
2. Calls `getErrorDiagnostics()` to filter to Error-severity only
3. If errors found, calls `formatDiagnostics()` for human-readable output and appends as `\n\n[Auto-diagnostics]\n...` to the tool result
4. The LLM sees the diagnostics inline with the write result and can fix issues immediately

The diagnostic utilities live in `src/utils/diagnosticWaiter.ts`:
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|")
| `waitForDiagnostics(uri, timeoutMs)` | Subscribes to `onDidChangeDiagnostics`, resolves when target URI appears or timeout |
| `formatDiagnostics(diagnostics, maxItems)` | Formats with human-readable severity (Error/Warning/Info/Hint), sorted by severity |
| `getErrorDiagnostics(diagnostics)` | Filters to `DiagnosticSeverity.Error` only |

#### Chunked `read_file` Interception

All `read_file` calls are intercepted **before** the normal tool execution path and routed through `executeChunkedRead()`. This prevents loading entire files into memory.

**Flow:**
1. `isReadFile` check at top of loop → `executeChunkedRead()` → `continue`
2. Resolve path via `resolveWorkspacePath()`
3. Count total lines via streaming (`countFileLines()`)
4. Loop in `CHUNK_SIZE` (100) line chunks:
   - Emit "running" UI action: `Reading ${fileName}` / `lines ${start}–${end}`
   - Stream just that range via `readFileChunk()`
   - Emit "success" UI action: `Read ${fileName}` / `lines ${start}–${end}`
   - Persist the success event
5. Concatenate all chunks, persist a **single** combined tool message to DB
6. Return combined content to LLM

**Key design decisions:**
- `readFile.ts` schema exposes only `path`/`file` — **no `startLine`/`endLine`** — so the LLM cannot bypass chunking
- Each chunk gets its own UI action with `filePath` and `startLine` for click-to-open navigation
- Chunk actions have `filePath` but **no `checkpointId`** — this is critical for `ProgressGroup.vue`'s `isCompletedFileGroup` guard (only file edits with checkpointId render flat)

### `AgentSummaryBuilder` — Post-Loop Finalization

Called once after the while-loop exits. Handles:
- Fallback LLM summary generation (when no accumulated explanation text)
- Tool summary line building (from last 6 tool results)
- Final assistant message persistence to DB
- `finalMessage` emission to webview
- `filesChanged` final emission with checkpoint
- Has its own `persistUiEvent` (does not share the executor's instance)

### `AgentSessionMemory` — Structured Notes Across Iterations

Maintains categorized notes (files read, files written, errors, user preferences, custom entries) that persist across agent loop iterations and are injected into the system prompt.

**Key methods:**
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|")
| `addEntry(category, content)` | Add a note under a category |
| `getCompactSummary()` | One-line summary: "2 files read, 1 files written, 3 errors encountered, 5 functions explored" |
| `autoExtractFunctionsExplored()` | Extracts function names from keyFindings matching code intelligence tool patterns (find_definition, get_call_hierarchy, etc.) |
| `toSystemPromptBlock()` | Render notes as `<session_memory>` XML block for system prompt |
| `toJSON()` | Serialize to JSON for DB persistence |
| `static fromJSON(json, outputChannel)` | Restore from persisted JSON (gracefully handles invalid input) |

**DB persistence:** The `sessions` table has a `session_memory TEXT` column (added via `ensureColumn` migration). After the agent loop completes, the executor saves memory via `databaseService.saveSessionMemory(sessionId, memory.toJSON())`. On session restore, memory is loaded via `databaseService.loadSessionMemory(sessionId)` and restored with `AgentSessionMemory.fromJSON()`.

### `AgentContextCompactor` — Conversation Summarization

Triggered when conversation tokens exceed ~70% of the model's context window. Summarizes earlier messages while preserving the system prompt and last 6 messages. The summary prompt requests structured analysis in 7 sections:

1. **CURRENT STATE** — what the task is and where we are
2. **WORK COMPLETED** — what has been done so far
3. **FILES INVOLVED** — which files were read/modified
4. **APPROACHES THAT FAILED** — what was tried and didn't work (prevents loops)
5. **PROMISES MADE** — commitments to revisit or follow up
6. **REMAINING WORK** — what still needs to be done
7. **KEY CONTEXT** — important technical details

The summary is wrapped in `<analysis>` XML tags to encourage structured output.

#### Token Category Breakdown (`estimateTokensByCategory`)

`estimateTokensByCategory(messages, contextWindow)` provides a heuristic breakdown of token usage by role/category. Returns a `TokenCategoryBreakdown` object:

| Category | Source |
|----------|--------|
| `system` | System prompt + non-tool-definition instructions |
| `toolDefinitions` | Tool schemas (extracted from system message JSON blocks) |
| `messages` | User + assistant conversation messages |
| `toolResults` | Tool role messages (function call results) |
| `files` | File content within user messages (heuristic: content >500 chars) |
| `total` | Sum of all categories |

Used by both executors to emit `tokenUsage` messages after each iteration. The breakdown feeds `TokenUsageIndicator.vue`'s popup panel. The estimates are **heuristic** (word count × 1.3) — the ring/bar use real `promptTokens` when available.

### `AgentPromptBuilder` — System Prompt Assembly

Builds the system prompt from modular sections. Key design principle: **for native tool calling models, tool-specific guidance lives in the tool descriptions (sent via `tools[]` API), NOT in the system prompt.** The system prompt focuses on behavioral rules only.

**Orchestrator prompt architecture**: The orchestrator (agent mode) prompt explicitly excludes `projectContextBlock` — project context auto-discovery is deferred to sub-agents via their explore/review prompts. This keeps the orchestrator prompt slim and focused on delegation.

**Native tool prompt sections** (`buildOrchestratorNativePrompt()`):
- `identity()`, `workspaceInfo()`, `toneAndStyle()`, `doingTasksOrchestrator()`, `orchestratorDelegationStrategy()`, `orchestratorToolPolicy()`, `executingWithCare()`, `userProvidedContext()`, `scratchpadDirectory()`, `completionSignal()`
- Does NOT include `projectContextBlock`, `codeNavigationStrategy()`, or `searchTips()` — these are for sub-agents
- `doingTasksOrchestrator()` focuses on delegation (no references to read_file/search_workspace), unlike `doingTasks()` which includes "Read before writing" guidance
- `orchestratorToolPolicy()` references only the 3 orchestrator tools, unlike `toolUsagePolicy()` which lists all tool alternatives

**XML fallback prompt** (`buildOrchestratorXmlPrompt()`):
- Includes ALL of the above PLUS `buildOrchestratorToolDefinitions_XML()`, `toolCallFormat()`, `searchTips()` — because XML models don't receive `tools[]`
- Also excludes `projectContextBlock`

**Deprecated aliases**: `buildNativeToolPrompt()` and `buildXmlFallbackPrompt()` delegate to the orchestrator variants — kept for backward compatibility.

**Orchestrator-only sections:**
| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `orchestratorDelegationStrategy()` | SCOUT→EXPLORE→WRITE→VERIFY workflow, sub-agent best practices |
| `doingTasksOrchestrator()` | Task execution rules focused on delegation — no read/search tool references |
| `orchestratorToolPolicy()` | Tool usage rules referencing only the 3 orchestrator tools |
| `getOrchestratorToolDefinitions()` | Filters `tools[]` to only `write_file`, `run_terminal_command`, `run_subagent` |
| `buildOrchestratorToolDefinitions_XML()` | Same filter for XML fallback mode |

| Section | Key Rules |
|---------|-----------|
| `toneAndStyle()` | PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVITY (technical accuracy over validation, investigate truth rather than confirming), no sycophantic openers, no time estimates |
| `doingTasks()` | Read before writing, match scope to request, keep it simple (no premature abstractions), verify with get_diagnostics, complete each step end-to-end |
| `toolUsagePolicy()` | Parallel tool calls, specialized tools over terminal, sub-agent delegation for complex research, auto-diagnostics after writes |
| `executingWithCare()` | Reversibility assessment, investigate before destroying, read error output before fixing |
| `completionSignal()` | Verify work compiles/lints cleanly before `[TASK_COMPLETE]`, include brief summary |

Mode-specific prompts:
- **Plan mode** — includes PLAN QUALITY RULES section (estimated complexity, concrete plans, risk callouts), EXPLORATION STRATEGY references all 12 tools
- **Security review** — expanded confidence scale (10/9/8 definitions, Low Confidence appendix), CODE INTELLIGENCE FOR SECURITY REVIEW maps all 8 LSP tools to security analysis patterns
- **Chat mode** — TOOL USAGE guidance, CODE INTELLIGENCE section with all 8 LSP tools, USER-PROVIDED CONTEXT section
- **Deep-explore mode** — 4-phase methodology (MAP → TRACE DEPTH-FIRST → CROSS-CUTTING ANALYSIS → SYNTHESIZE), CRITICAL RULES (DEPTH OVER BREADTH, DON'T STOP EARLY, FOLLOW IMPORTS, USE PARALLEL CALLS)

### Shared Types Location

All core agent types (`Tool`, `ToolContext`, `ExecutorConfig`, `PersistUiEventFn`) live in `src/types/agent.ts`. Both `toolRegistry.ts` and `agentTerminalHandler.ts` re-export them for backward compatibility, but new code should import from `types/agent` directly.

### Sub-Handler Dependency Pattern

Sub-handlers receive their dependencies via constructor injection (not by holding a reference to the executor). This prevents circular dependencies:

```typescript
// PersistUiEventFn type — defined in src/types/agent.ts (shared location)
export type PersistUiEventFn = (
  sessionId: string | undefined,
  eventType: string,
  payload: Record<string, any>
) => Promise<void>;

// Executor binds its own method and passes it down
const persistFn = this.persistUiEvent.bind(this);
this.terminalHandler = new AgentTerminalHandler(..., persistFn, ...);
```

### ⚠️ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Do This Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Adding streaming logic to `agentChatExecutor.ts` | Executor becomes a god class again | Add to `agentStreamProcessor.ts` |
| Adding per-tool execution logic to `agentChatExecutor.ts` | Same — executor must stay thin | Add to `agentToolRunner.ts` |
| Importing `AgentChatExecutor` from a sub-handler | Creates circular dependency | Use `PersistUiEventFn` callback type instead |
| Making `AgentStreamProcessor` aware of tool execution | Violates streaming ↔ execution boundary | Stream processor returns `StreamResult`, executor decides what to do with it. Exception: the stream processor MAY emit `collapseThinking` and transient `showThinking` spinners on tool_call detection (UI-only, no persistence) |
| Putting DB persistence logic in stream processor | Stream processor should only handle UI emission | Persistence belongs in executor or tool runner |

## Agent Dispatcher — Intent Classification

Before the agent loop starts, `AgentDispatcher` classifies the user's intent to determine executor routing and system prompt framing. This prevents intent misclassification (e.g., model refactoring code when the user asked for documentation).

**File**: `src/agent/execution/orchestration/agentDispatcher.ts`

**Classification flow**:
1. **LLM classification** (no timeout — waits for model response, caller shows spinner via `showThinking`) — sends the user message to the model with a short classification prompt, expects JSON: `{"intent":"analyze|modify|create|mixed","needsWrite":true|false,"reasoning":"..."}`. Uses `keep_alive: '30m'` to keep the model loaded.
2. **Fallback** — if LLM errors (network failure, malformed response), defaults to `mixed` intent with `needsWrite=true` (unrestricted agent). No keyword heuristics — the LLM is the sole classifier.

**Routing table**:

| Intent | `needsWrite` | Route | Prompt |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| `analyze` | `false` | `agentExploreExecutor` (deep-explore mode) | Deep exploration, read-only tools |
| `analyze` | `true` | `agentExploreExecutor` (deep-explore-write mode) | Deep exploration + write_file for docs output |
| `modify` | any | `agentChatExecutor` | `doingTasks(modify)` — targeted changes only |
| `create` | any | `agentChatExecutor` | `doingTasks(create)` — match existing patterns |
| `mixed` | any | `agentChatExecutor` | `doingTasks(mixed)` — full default rules |

**`DispatchResult`** (from `src/types/agent.ts`):
- `intent: TaskIntent` — classified intent
- `needsWrite: boolean` — whether the task requires file creation
- `confidence: number` — 0-1 (LLM ≈ 0.85, 0 = classification failed)
- `reasoning: string` — diagnostic explanation

The `intent` is passed through to `AgentPromptBuilder.doingTasks(intent)` which adapts its existing TASK EXECUTION section — no separate framing text is generated.

**Anti-pattern**: Do NOT bypass the dispatcher for agent mode messages. All messages in agent mode must go through `dispatcher.classify()` before reaching an executor.

## Agent Execution Flow

When user sends a message in Agent mode:

```
1. handleAgentMode()
   ├─ AgentDispatcher.classify() — intent classification
   │   ├─ analyze + no writes → route to explore executor (deep-explore)
   │   ├─ analyze + needs writes → route to explore executor (deep-explore-write, adds write_file)
   │   └─ all other intents → continue to agent executor
   ├─ Create agent session
   ├─ Create git branch (if enabled)
   └─ agentChatExecutor.execute(dispatch)   ← AgentChatExecutor.execute() method
       ├─ Detect tool calling mode:

       ├─ Create checkpoint (SQLite) → currentCheckpointId
       └─ LOOP (max iterations):

           │   │   │   │                → AgentFileEditHandler.execute()
           │   │   │   │                  → fileSensitivity → approval flow

       │   ├─ Post 'finalMessage' to webview
       │   ├─ Persist + post 'filesChanged' with checkpointId (if files modified)

   ← Back in handleAgentMode():
       → reviewService.startReviewForCheckpoint(checkpointId)
       → Post 'generationStopped'
```

## Native Tool Calling vs XML Fallback

The executor supports two tool calling paths, selected based on model capabilities:

| Path | When Used | Request | Response | History Format |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Native** | Model has `tools` capability | `chatRequest.tools = [ToolDefinition...]` | `chunk.message.tool_calls: [{function:{name, arguments}}]` | `{role:'tool', content, tool_name}` per tool |
| **XML fallback** | Model lacks `tools` capability | Tool descriptions in system prompt | `<tool_call>{"name":"...", "arguments":{...}}</tool_call>` in text | Accumulated `{role:'user', content}` message |

**Native tool calling conversation structure** (matches [Ollama docs](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/tool-calling)):
```
[system] You are a coding agent...
[user] Create a hello world file
[assistant, content: "[Reasoning completed]", tool_calls: [{function:{name:"write_file", arguments:{...}}}]]
[tool, tool_name: "write_file"] File written successfully
[assistant, content: "Done!"] [TASK_COMPLETE]
```

**Key rules:**
- Assistant messages MUST NOT include `thinking` — per Ollama #10448 / Qwen3 docs: "No Thinking Content in History." Including it causes the model to see all previous reasoning → repetition loops. Use `'[Reasoning completed]'` as `content` when response is empty.
- Tool result messages MUST include `tool_name` — without it, the model can't match results to calls in multi-tool responses
- Both executors defensively strip `thinking` from ALL messages before building the chatRequest
- Do NOT deduplicate tool calls — Ollama sends each as a complete object in its own chunk; dedup would drop legitimate repeated calls
- `ToolCall` type has optional `id`, `type`, and `function.index` fields — Ollama returns `type: 'function'` and `function.index` but NOT `id`

### tool_calls DB Persistence

Native `tool_calls` metadata is persisted in the `messages` table so that multi-turn session history correctly reconstructs the full `assistant(tool_calls) → tool(result)` pairing. Without this, reloaded sessions would show orphaned `role: 'tool'` results with no preceding assistant tool_calls — causing the model to lose context about which tool produced which result.

**Schema:** The `messages` table has a `tool_calls TEXT` column (nullable). Assistant messages with native tool calls store the serialized JSON array: `JSON.stringify(nativeToolCalls)`.

**Persistence (both executors):** After pushing the assistant message to in-memory history, the executor also persists the tool_calls metadata to the DB with the **original response text** (not `historyContent` which has thinking injected). If `iterationDelta` was already persisted, the content is empty to avoid duplicate text:
```typescript
if (useNativeTools && nativeToolCalls.length > 0 && sessionId) {
  const serializedToolCalls = JSON.stringify(nativeToolCalls);
  const persistContent = hasPersistedIterationText ? '' : (response.trim() || '');
  await this.databaseService.addMessage(sessionId, 'assistant', persistContent, {
    model, toolCalls: serializedToolCalls
  });
}
```

**History reconstruction:** When loading messages from the DB for a continued session, the history builder reconstructs `tool_calls` from the stored JSON:
```typescript
if (m.role === 'assistant' && m.tool_calls) {
  try { msg.tool_calls = JSON.parse(m.tool_calls); } catch { }
}
```

**Filter rule:** Assistant messages with empty `content` but non-empty `tool_calls` are preserved (not filtered out). This is critical because some models emit tool calls with no accompanying text.

## ToolRegistry (`src/agent/toolRegistry.ts`)

Manages tool registration, lookup, and execution. The registry itself is a slim class (~110 LOC) — individual tool implementations live in `src/agent/tools/`, one file per tool.

```

### Shared Types (`src/types/agent.ts`)

All core agent types are centralised in `src/types/agent.ts`:
- `Tool` — tool definition (name, description, schema, execute)
- `ToolContext` — runtime context for tool execution
- `ExecutorConfig` — agent loop configuration (maxIterations, toolTimeout, temperature)
- `PersistUiEventFn` — callback type for DB persistence

`toolRegistry.ts` and `agentTerminalHandler.ts` re-export these types for backward compatibility.

**Built-in Tools (14 total):**

*Core tools:*
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents (streaming, chunked in 100-line blocks via `countFileLines` + `readFileChunk`; see `src/agent/tools/filesystem/readFile.ts`) |
| `write_file` | Write/create file (handles both) |
| `list_files` | List directory contents (output includes `basePath` for click handling) |
| `search_workspace` | Search for text or regex patterns in files (ripgrep-based; supports `isRegex` flag, optional `directory` param to scope to a specific workspace folder or subdirectory) |
| `run_terminal_command` | Execute shell commands |
| `get_diagnostics` | Get file errors/warnings |

*LSP-powered code intelligence tools (all delegate to `vscode.commands.executeCommand` → active language server):*
| Tool | VS Code Command | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `get_document_symbols` | `vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider` | File outline — classes, functions, methods with line ranges + nesting. Cheapest way to understand file structure. |
| `find_definition` | `vscode.executeDefinitionProvider` | Go-to-definition — follow a function/method call to its source across files. |
| `find_references` | `vscode.executeReferenceProvider` | Find all usages of a symbol across the workspace, grouped by file (capped at 30). |
| `find_implementations` | `vscode.executeImplementationProvider` | Find concrete implementations of interfaces/abstract classes/methods. |
| `find_symbol` | `vscode.executeWorkspaceSymbolProvider` | Search symbols (functions, classes) by name across workspace using the language server index. |
| `get_hover_info` | `vscode.executeHoverProvider` | Type signatures, JSDoc/docstrings, and parameter info for any symbol. |
| `get_call_hierarchy` | `vscode.prepareCallHierarchy` + `provideIncomingCalls`/`provideOutgoingCalls` | Call chain tracing — incoming (who calls this?) and/or outgoing (what does this call?). |
| `get_type_hierarchy` | `vscode.prepareTypeHierarchy` + `provideSupertypes`/`provideSubtypes` | Inheritance chain — supertypes and subtypes of a class/interface. |

*Sub-agent tool:*
| Tool | Mechanism | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `run_subagent` | `context.runSubagent()` callback → `AgentExploreExecutor.executeSubagent()` | Launch an isolated read-only sub-agent for complex investigation tasks. Accepts `task` (string), `title` (string, required — 3-5 word summary shown as progress label), optional `description` (string — one-sentence description shown alongside the title in the progress group header), optional `context_hint` (string — focus hint prepended to task, e.g. "start from src/auth/"), and optional `mode` (`'explore'`, `'review'`, or `'deep-explore'`). Runs with `isSubagent=true` — suppresses streaming, thinking, token usage, and `finalMessage` to prevent polluting the parent's webview timeline. Renders as a dedicated collapsible progress group titled `Sub-agent: <title>` with optional detail text and the sub-agent's tool actions nested inside. Findings are returned as text to the parent agent only — the user does NOT see them. The parent must act on the findings itself. The sub-agent model is resolved via 3-tier fallback (session → global → agent model) — see Explorer Model Resolution. The parent's detected primary workspace is forwarded to the sub-agent so it correctly identifies which folder to scope exploration to in multi-root workspaces. |

**Tool Call Format (in LLM responses):**
```xml
<tool_call>{"name": "read_file", "arguments": {"path": "src/file.ts"}}</tool_call>
```

## Tool Call Parser (`src/utils/toolCallParser.ts`)

Parses tool calls from LLM responses. This is critical for agent functionality and must handle various LLM output quirks robustly.

**Key Functions:**
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `extractToolCalls(response)` | Parse all tool calls from response text |
| `detectPartialToolCall(response)` | Detect in-progress tool call during streaming |
| `removeToolCalls(response)` | Strip tool call markup for display |

### Robustness Features

The parser handles various LLM quirks that smaller models (like devstral-small) may produce:

1. **Balanced JSON Extraction** - Uses brace counting instead of regex to properly extract nested JSON:
   ```typescript
   // WRONG: /<tool_call>\s*(\{[\s\S]*?\})\s*<\/tool_call>/  (stops at first })
   // RIGHT: extractBalancedJson() counts { and } to find matching close
   ```

2. **Multiple Argument Field Names** - Accepts `arguments`, `args`, `params`, or `parameters`:
   ```json
   {"name": "read_file", "args": {"path": "file.ts"}}  // works
   {"name": "read_file", "arguments": {"path": "file.ts"}}  // works
   ```

3. **Top-Level Arguments** - Accepts args at root level instead of nested:
   ```json
   {"name": "read_file", "path": "file.ts"}  // works (path extracted from top level)
   ```

4. **Multiple Tool Name Fields** - Accepts `name`, `tool`, or `function`:
   ```json
   {"tool": "read_file", "arguments": {"path": "file.ts"}}  // works
   ```

5. **Incomplete Tool Calls** - Handles LLM getting cut off mid-response:
   ```xml
   <tool_call>{"name": "write_file", "arguments": {"path": "x.ts", "content": "...
   ```
   The parser attempts to repair by adding missing closing braces.

6. **Bare JSON Fallback** - When no XML `<tool_call>` or bracket `[TOOL_CALLS]` format is detected, the parser falls back to extracting bare JSON objects that match the tool call schema:
   ```json
   {"name": "read_file", "arguments": {"path": "src/main.ts"}}
   ```
   This handles models (like Qwen2.5-Coder) that sometimes emit raw JSON tool calls without any wrapping format. The bare JSON is also extracted from code fences (`` ```json ... ``` ``). This fallback only activates when the primary parsers found zero tool calls — it never interferes with properly formatted output.

   **`knownToolNames` validation:** The `extractToolCalls()` function accepts an optional `knownToolNames: Set<string>` parameter. When provided, the bare JSON fallback only accepts tool calls whose `name` field is in the set — this prevents false positives from JSON snippets in the response that happen to match the tool call schema. XML and bracket-format calls are NOT filtered by `knownToolNames`. Both executors pass `toolRegistry.getToolNames()` when in XML mode (native tool mode doesn't need it since tool calls come from the API, not text parsing).

   **`stripBareJsonToolCalls()`:** Companion function that removes bare JSON tool call objects from a response string so they don't leak into user-visible assistant text. Used by `agentStreamProcessor.ts` when bare JSON pre-scan detects a known tool name in the streaming text.

#### Over-Eager Tool Mitigation

Models sometimes request an excessive number of tool calls in a single batch (e.g., 20+ `read_file` calls). Two thresholds prevent this from exhausting context or slowing execution:

| Threshold | Constant | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Soft warning | `TOOL_COUNT_WARN = 8` | All tools executed, but a `[SYSTEM NOTE]` is injected advising fewer tools per iteration |
| Hard truncation | `TOOL_COUNT_HARD = 15` | Only the first 15 tools are executed; remaining are dropped with a `[SYSTEM NOTE]` explaining the truncation |

**Implementation locations:**
- `agentToolRunner.ts` `executeBatch()` — applies both thresholds for orchestrator tool batches
- `agentExploreExecutor.ts` — applies `TOOL_COUNT_HARD` (15) for explore executor's inline tool execution

The injected messages appear as `role: 'tool'` with `tool_name: 'system'` (native mode) or appended to `xmlResults` (XML mode).

### Tool Argument Flexibility

Tools in `toolRegistry.ts` also accept multiple argument names for the file path:
- `path`, `file`, or `filePath` are all valid for `read_file`, `write_file`, `get_diagnostics`

## Path Resolution (`src/agent/tools/filesystem/pathUtils.ts`)

All built-in tools resolve file paths through `resolveWorkspacePath()` (single-root) or `resolveMultiRootPath()` (multi-root capable).

### `resolveMultiRootPath` — Folder-Name Prefix Stripping

`vscode.workspace.asRelativePath(path, true)` returns paths prefixed with the workspace folder name (e.g. `"demo-project/rss-fetch.ts"` for a workspace at `/home/user/demo-project/`). When this value is used as a relative path and joined with the folder's URI, the folder name doubles:

```
"demo-project/rss-fetch.ts" joined with /home/user/demo-project/
 → /home/user/demo-project/demo-project/rss-fetch.ts  ← WRONG (ENOENT)
```

**Resolution order** (checked sequentially):

1. **Absolute paths** → returned as-is
2. **Single-root fast path** (≤1 workspace folder):
   a. If `relativePath` exactly equals the folder name → return folder root (prevents doubling for `list_files(path="myproject")`)
   b. If `relativePath` starts with `folderName + '/'` → strip prefix with `fs.existsSync` guard (keeps real subdirectories)
   c. Fall back to `path.join(primary, relativePath)`
3. **Multi-root — bare folder name** (no path separators): If `relativePath` matches any workspace folder name → return that folder's root directly. This is checked BEFORE trying `path.join` to prevent matching a same-named subdirectory in another workspace folder.
4. **Multi-root — primary workspace**: Try `path.join(primary, relativePath)` — use if exists
5. **Multi-root — other folders**: Try each additional folder — use if exists
6. **Multi-root — folder-name prefix**: If first path segment matches a folder name and `rest` exists under that folder → strip prefix
7. **Fallback**: `path.join(primary, relativePath)` (safe for writes)

### `search_workspace` — Regex Support, Directory Scoping & Output Format

The tool supports both plain-text and regex searches via the `isRegex` parameter, and optional directory scoping via the `directory` parameter.

**Directory scoping** (`directory` param):
- In **multi-root workspaces**, pass a workspace folder name (e.g. `"search-node-master"`) to restrict results to that folder
- In any workspace, pass a relative subdirectory (e.g. `"src/controllers"`) to narrow the search
- When omitted, all workspace folders are searched
- The system prompt tells the model about this parameter in the `WORKSPACE` section
- Defensive: the tool re-reads `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders` at execution time in case the context was stale

The LLM is guided toward regex through:

1. **Tool description**: Explains when to use `isRegex=true` (uncertain casing, alternatives, wildcards)
2. **Schema**: `query` and `isRegex` field descriptions mention `(?i)`, `|`, `.*` syntax
3. **System prompt**: Both native tool-calling and XML fallback system prompts include a `SEARCH TIPS` section with concrete examples

**Output format** (consumed by `toolUIFormatter.ts` for UI rendering):
```
── src/services/myService.ts ──
  10: context line before
→ 11: matching line here
  12: context line after

── src/utils/helper.ts ──
→ 5: another match
```

- `── file ──` headers mark file boundaries
- `→ N:` marks matching lines (with line number)
- Indented lines without `→` are context lines

The UI formatter (`getToolSuccessInfo` for `search_workspace`) parses this format into a structured listing with `📄 path\tmatchCount` entries, displayed in the progress group as a clickable file tree.

## LSP-Powered Code Intelligence Tools

The agent has 8 tools that delegate to VS Code's built-in Language Server Protocol commands (`vscode.commands.executeCommand`). These work for **any language** that has a VS Code extension with LSP support (TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust, etc.) — the agent gets "go to definition", "find references", "document outline", type info, and call hierarchy for free with zero custom parsing.

### Why LSP Tools Matter

Without LSP tools, the agent can only do text search (`search_workspace`) and manual file reading (`read_file`). With them:
- **`get_document_symbols`** gives the agent a file's structure (classes, functions, line ranges) in one call vs reading the entire file
- **`find_definition`** lets the agent follow function calls across files — the single most important tool for deep code understanding
- **`find_references`** shows impact surface before modifying shared code
- **`find_symbol`** finds a class/function by name without knowing which file it's in (uses the language server's semantic index, not raw text search)
- **`get_hover_info`** gives type signatures + JSDoc without navigating to definition files
- **`get_call_hierarchy`** traces call chains — incoming (who calls this?) and outgoing (what does this call?)
- **`find_implementations`** finds concrete classes implementing an interface
- **`get_type_hierarchy`** shows inheritance chains — supertypes and subtypes

### Shared Position Resolution (`symbolResolver.ts`)

Multiple LSP tools need to convert `{path, symbolName?, line?, character?}` into a precise `{uri, position}`. This is centralised in `src/agent/tools/lsp/symbolResolver.ts`:

**Resolution strategy:**
1. If `line` + `character` are both provided → use directly (1-based → 0-based conversion)
2. If `symbolName` is provided → search the document text for the symbol
   - If `line` is also given → prefer the occurrence closest to that line
   - Falls back to case-insensitive search if exact match not found
3. If only `line` is given → use with character 0

**Why symbolName?** LLMs are better at naming symbols than specifying exact positions. The agent can say `find_definition({path: "src/main.ts", symbolName: "handleRequest"})` instead of needing to know the exact line/column.

**Exported utilities:**
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `resolveSymbolPosition(params, workspace, allFolders)` | Path + name/position → `{ uri, position }` |
| `readContextAroundLocation(uri, line, contextLines)` | Read surrounding lines (with `→` marker on target line) |
| `formatLocation(location, contextLines)` | Format a `Location`/`LocationLink` to readable string |

### Execution Routing

All LSP tools (and all other non-terminal, non-file-edit tools) go through the standard `ToolRegistry.execute()` path with **no special routing** in `agentToolRunner.ts`. Unlike `write_file` (approval) or `run_terminal_command` (safety), these are read-only and need no approval flow.

### LSP Tool Availability

LSP results depend on having an active language server for the file type:
- TypeScript/JavaScript: Built-in TS server — always available
- Python, Java, Rust, etc.: Requires the user to have the language extension installed
- Plain text files or unsupported languages: Tools return "No X found" messages (graceful degradation, not errors)

### Progress Group Titles for LSP Tools

`getProgressGroupTitle()` in `toolUIFormatter.ts` categorizes LSP tool batches:
- `find_definition`, `find_references`, `find_implementations`, `get_hover_info`, `get_call_hierarchy`, `get_type_hierarchy` → **"Analyzing code"**
- `find_symbol` (grouped with `search_workspace`) → **"Searching codebase"**
- `get_document_symbols` (without writes) → **"Inspecting file structure"**

### System Prompt Guidance

Both native tool-calling and XML fallback system prompts include two key guidance sections:

**1. `USER-PROVIDED CONTEXT` section** — tells the LLM that code blocks attached by the user are already available inline and should NOT be re-read with `read_file`. See "User-Provided Context Pipeline" below.

**2. `CODE NAVIGATION STRATEGY` section** — tells the LLM **when** to use each tool:
- Use `get_document_symbols` before reading large files
- Use `find_definition` to follow function calls
- Use `find_references` before modifying shared code
- Use `find_symbol` when you don't know which file a symbol is in
- Use `get_hover_info` for type/signature inspection
- Use `get_call_hierarchy` for call chain tracing
- Use `find_implementations` for interface/abstract implementations
- Use `get_type_hierarchy` for inheritance chains

This guidance is in `buildAgentSystemPrompt()` in `agentChatExecutor.ts`.

## User-Provided Context Pipeline

When a user attaches code (selected lines or whole files) to a chat message, the content flows through a multi-stage pipeline before reaching the LLM. Understanding this pipeline prevents the common bug where the agent **ignores provided context and re-reads the entire file**.

### Data Flow

```
Editor selection / active file
  → EditorContextTracker.ts: sends editorContext payload to webview
    → Webview state.ts: stores as implicitFile / implicitSelection
      → User pins selection or sends message
        → handleSend() / pinSelection() in actions/input.ts + actions/implicitContext.ts
          → Builds ContextFileRef[] array with {fileName, content, kind}
            → postMessage({type: 'sendMessage', text, context: ContextFileRef[]})
              → chatMessageHandler.ts: resolves __implicit_file__ markers
                → Formats contextStr with descriptive labels
                  → Prepends to user message as fullPrompt
                    → LLM sees context at start of user turn
```

### Context String Format (sent to LLM)

The context is formatted with **descriptive labels** that signal to the LLM that the code is already available:

```
User's selected code from search-node-master/src/ProcessSearch.ts:L409-L843 (already provided — do not re-read):
```
<actual selected code>
```

Contents of config.ts (already provided — do not re-read):
```
<file contents>
```

User's actual question text here
```

The labels are constructed in `chatMessageHandler.ts`:
- **Selections** (fileName contains `:L<digits>`): `User's selected code from <fileName> (already provided — do not re-read):`
- **Whole files**: `Contents of <fileName> (already provided — do not re-read):`

### System Prompt Reinforcement

`buildAgentSystemPrompt()` includes a `USER-PROVIDED CONTEXT` section that reinforces the labels:

```
USER-PROVIDED CONTEXT:
The user may attach code from their editor to the message. This appears at the start of their message in blocks like:
  [file.ts:L10-L50] (selected lines 10–50)
  [file.ts] (whole file)
The code inside those blocks is ALREADY AVAILABLE to you — do NOT re-read it with read_file.
Use the provided content directly for analysis, explanation, or edits.
Only use read_file if you need lines OUTSIDE the provided range, or a different file entirely.
```

This two-level approach (descriptive labels in the user message + explicit instruction in the system prompt) helps the LLM understand it already has the code and should not waste tool calls re-reading it.

### Context Kinds

| Kind | When | fileName Format | Content |
|------|------|----------------|----------|
| `implicit-selection` | User has text selected in editor | `folder/file.ts:L10-L50` | Actual selected text |
| `implicit-file` | Active file in editor (non-agent modes only) | `folder/file.ts` | First 8000 chars of file |
| `explicit` | User manually attached via attach button | `folder/file.ts` or `folder/file.ts:L10-L50` | File/selection content |

### Multi-Root Workspace Paths

In multi-root workspaces, `relativePath` includes the workspace folder name prefix (e.g. `search-node-master/src/ProcessSearch.ts`). This is derived from `vscode.workspace.asRelativePath(uri, true)` and propagated through the full chain:
- `EditorContextTracker` → `activeFile.relativePath` / `activeSelection.relativePath`
- Webview state → `implicitFile.relativePath` / `implicitSelection.relativePath`
- `pinSelection()` / `handleSend()` → used as `fileName` in context items
- `chatMessageHandler.ts` → uses relative paths for `__implicit_file__` resolution

### Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/views/editorContextTracker.ts` | Sends `editorContext` with `relativePath` to webview |
| `src/webview/scripts/core/state.ts` | Stores `implicitFile` / `implicitSelection` with `relativePath` |
| `src/webview/scripts/core/actions/input.ts` | `handleSend()` — builds context array, uses relativePath for fileNames |
| `src/webview/scripts/core/actions/implicitContext.ts` | `pinSelection()` — stores content + relativePath-based fileName |
| `src/views/messageHandlers/chatMessageHandler.ts` | Resolves `__implicit_file__` markers, formats contextStr with descriptive labels |
| `src/agent/execution/orchestration/agentChatExecutor.ts` | `buildAgentSystemPrompt()` — includes USER-PROVIDED CONTEXT section |

## Streaming Behavior

### First-Chunk Gate
The executor uses a 32ms throttle for streaming text to the UI. The **first chunk** requires ≥8 word characters before the spinner is replaced with text. This prevents partial markdown fragments like `**What` from flashing on screen. After the first chunk, any content with ≥1 word character is shown.

### `[TASK_COMPLETE]` Stripping
The control signal `[TASK_COMPLETE]` is stripped from all displayed content:
- Full match: regex `/\[TASK_COMPLETE\]/gi`
- Partial prefix: a reverse scan strips any trailing prefix of `[TASK_COMPLETE]` (e.g. `[TASK`, `[TAS`) since tokens arrive incrementally
- Applied to: streamed text, thinking content, and persisted thinking blocks

### Terminal Command CWD Resolution
`executeTerminalCommand()` resolves the `cwd` argument relative to the workspace root. Absolute paths that fall outside the workspace are clamped to the workspace root. If no `cwd` is provided, commands run in the workspace root.

### Write Validation

The agent executor tracks whether a task requires file writes (based on keywords like "rename", "modify", "create", etc.) and validates that `write_file` was actually called before accepting `[TASK_COMPLETE]`. This prevents the LLM from hallucinating task completion.

## Terminal Command Execution

### Shell Integration Requirement
Terminal commands execute via `TerminalManager` (`src/services/terminalManager.ts`), which **requires VS Code Terminal Shell Integration** (VS Code 1.93+). The manager waits up to 5 seconds for shell integration to appear; if unavailable, it throws a hard error.

### Session-Keyed Terminals
Terminals are **keyed by session ID** — one terminal per agent session, reused across all commands in that session. Terminals are auto-cleaned when VS Code closes them.

### Output Handling
- Output is truncated to **100 lines** (15 head + 85 tail) with a `[N lines truncated]` marker
- ANSI escape sequences and VS Code `]633;` shell integration markers are stripped
- **Caveat**: `waitForCommandEnd()` relies on the `onDidEndTerminalShellExecution` event. If the event never fires (shell integration bug), the promise never resolves — there is no timeout

## Command Safety & Approval Flow

### Severity Tiers (`src/agent/execution/approval/commandSafety.ts`)
`analyzeDangerousCommand()` returns a severity from highest-match in a static regex pattern array:

| Severity | Examples | Behavior |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `critical` | `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, `mkfs`, `dd if=` | **Always requires approval** — ignores auto-approve |
| `high` | `sudo`, `chmod 777`, `kill -9`, `npm publish` | Requires approval unless auto-approved |
| `medium` | `npm install`, `pip install`, `docker run` | Requires approval unless auto-approved |
| `none` | `ls`, `cat`, `echo` | Auto-approved if toggle enabled |

### Approval Decision (`src/agent/execution/approval/terminalApproval.ts`)
`computeTerminalApprovalDecision()` returns the final decision:
1. **Critical severity** → always requires approval (regardless of `auto_approve_commands`)
2. **Auto-approve enabled** → approve and persist result with `autoApproved: true`
3. **Otherwise** → show approval card in UI and wait for user response

### File Edit Approval (`src/utils/fileSensitivity.ts`)
File edits go through a separate sensitivity check:
1. Evaluate file path against `sensitiveFilePatterns` (**last-match-wins** pattern order)
2. If file is sensitive and `auto_approve_sensitive_edits` is `false` → show approval card with diff
3. Non-sensitive files are written directly without approval

> ⚠️ **INVERTED BOOLEAN — READ CAREFULLY**
>
> In `sensitiveFilePatterns`, `true` means **auto-approve** (file is NOT sensitive).
> `false` means **require approval** (file IS sensitive).
>
> The boolean answers "is this file safe to auto-approve?" — NOT "is this file sensitive?".
>
> ```typescript
> // ✅ CORRECT: .env requires approval → set to false
> { pattern: '**/.env', value: false }
>
> // ❌ WRONG: Don't set .env to true thinking "yes it's sensitive"
> { pattern: '**/.env', value: true }  // This DISABLES approval!
> ```

### UI Flow for Approvals

Both terminal and file edit approvals follow the **persist+post sequence** defined in CRITICAL RULE #1 of `copilot-instructions.md`. The full event ordering table is there. Here is the approval-specific flow:

```
1. persistUiEvent + postMessage → 'showToolAction' (status: 'pending')
2. persistUiEvent + postMessage → 'requestToolApproval' | 'requestFileEditApproval'
   ── wait for user response ──
3. persistUiEvent + postMessage → 'toolApprovalResult' | 'fileEditApprovalResult'
4. [execute command / apply edit]
5. persistUiEvent + postMessage → 'showToolAction' (status: 'success' | 'error')
```

**Key rule**: Every `postMessage` MUST have a matching `persistUiEvent` in the same order. See CRITICAL RULE #1 for the full event table and debugging guide.

## Adding a New Tool

> **Full step-by-step guide**: See the `add-agent-tool` skill (`.github/skills/add-agent-tool/SKILL.md`).

Each tool lives in its own file under `src/agent/tools/`. Quick summary:

1. **Create tool file** — `src/agent/tools/myTool.ts` exporting a `Tool` object (`{ name, description, schema, execute }`).
2. **Register in barrel** — Add to `builtInTools[]` in `src/agent/tools/index.ts`.
3. **Add UI mapping** — Add a `case` in `getToolActionInfo()` in `src/views/toolUIFormatter.ts`.
4. **Add to Settings UI** (if toggleable) — `src/webview/components/settings/components/features/ToolsSection.vue`.
5. **Write tests** — `tests/extension/suite/agent/toolRegistry.test.ts`.

Execution routing: `agentToolRunner.ts` calls `ToolRegistry.execute()` for standard tools. Terminal commands and file edits have dedicated sub-handlers (`agentTerminalHandler.ts`, `agentFileEditHandler.ts`).
